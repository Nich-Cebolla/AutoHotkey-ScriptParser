/**
 * @description - `HandleContinuation` is a parsing function for use with AHK code. It takes a
 * a string input which is expected to be AHK code, and also a `RegExMatchInfo` object that
 * has a subcapture group consisting of just the text following the assignment / arrow operator
 * of a function or property definition statement. `HandleContinuation` will analyze the subcapture
 * group along with subsequent lines. If the lines are joined by a continuation operator or bracket,
 * this function will concatenate the related lines into a single string.
 * - **Note** that, in this description and in the code, "Body" refers to the text content that follows
 * the arrow function operator or assignment operator, including the entire continuation section.
 * - **Limitations**:
 *   - If any quoted strings or comments contain a bracket that does not have its closing pair nearby,
 * the string may need to be removed prior to calling `HandleContinuation`.
 *   - The function is not designed to handle string continuation sections as described here:
 * {@link https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/Scripts.htm#continuation-section}.
 * @param {VarRef} Text - The text to search. `Text` is expected to be AHK code. `Text` can be
 * the entire code source / script that is being analyzed, but if that content is particularly large,
 * you can narrow the input by following these guidelines:
 * - The beginning of `Text` can be the same as the beginning of the `Match` object (second parameter).
 * - The end of `Text` should encompass enough lines of code to be certain that, if a continuation
 * section is present at the position of `Match.Pos[Subgroup]`, the entire continuation section
 * is included in `Text`.
 * @param {RegExInfo} Match - The RegEx match object. Minimally, the match object needs to have
 * these characteristics:
 * - The object has a subcapture group that contains a single line of code.
 * - The subcapture group is a property or function definition statement that has an assignment
 * operator or arrow function operator. This function does not work with definition statements
 * that are bracketed; getting that content is comparatively much easier.
 *
 * If you aren't sure where to begin drafting a pattern that will work with this function, the
 * below pattern will match with any function definition or property definition statement which
 * use an arrow function operator. Both statements will include several subcapture groups:
 * - **indent**: The indent prior to the statement, if any.
 * - **static**: The `static` keyword, if present.
 * - **name**: The name of the function or property.
 * - **params**: The parameters of the function or property, if present. The encompassing brackets
 * are included in the subcapture group.
 * - **arrow**: The arrow function operator (=>).
 * - **body**: The line of code following the arrow function operator. This is the subgroup that is
 * expected to be passed to this function.
 *
 * Also included is a `Mark` which you can use to determine if a property was matched or if a
 * class method / function was matched. Example: `if Match.Mark == 'func'`.
 * @example

        'iJm)'

        '\s*'
        '(?<arrow>=>)'
        '(?<body>.+)'
    )
* @
* @param {String} [Operator] - The initial operator used, i.e. an assignment operator or an arrow
* function operator (=>). When provided, this allows the function to combine the body text with
* the preceding text included in the input match. When not provided, the function only returns
* the body text, in which case `OutBody` is the same as the return value, and `OutLen` receives
* the same value as `OutLenBody`.
* @param {String} [Subgroup='body'] - The name of the subgroup that captures the line of text with
* the continuation operator, as described in the description and in the parameter hint for `Match`.
* @param {VarRef} [OutPosEnd] - A variable that will receive the ending position of the match
* relative to Text.
* @param {VarRef} [OutLen] - If `Operator` is defined, this will receive the length of the entire
* content string including input match and the result of this function. If `Operator` is not defined,
* this will receive the length of the result of this function, which will be the same as `OutLenBody`.
* @param {VarRef} [OutBody] - A variable that will receive the portion of text that occurs
* after the initial operator, beginning with the text contained in the input match's subgroup.
* If `Operator` is not defined, this is the same as the return value.
* @param {VarRef} [OutLenBody] - A variable that will receive the length of `OutBody`.
* @returns {String} - The complete statement.
